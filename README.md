# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

This Java based program, consists of a class that defines a character in a text based role playing game, and a main file that implements and provides testing for the character class. The class is a work in progress, but provides the primary structures of a character in a role playing game, including class behaviors and inventory management. This project is meant to display certain aspects of the Java programming language, namely using the "implements" keyword to access the Serializable interface. Implementing the Serializable interface with the Character class allows the character class objects created in the game to be saved to file and loaded again later.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
